# kite-api
Buy stocks using the kite API and using an excel find the ideal conditions to buy a stock in NSE

To use this program you need to first download the excel and analyse the data for the previous day. Once done analysing 473 stocks you should have an updated list of 
all the important small to large cap stocks.

Then run the main.py file. It will automatically check the current time and once the time hits 9:15 AM it will execute the filtered list of stocks that are ideal to buy
that day.

NOTE: You need to provide it with your Kite credientials to execute your order.
